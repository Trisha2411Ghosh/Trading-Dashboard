# PostgreSql Folder

This folder contains the necessary files to set up and manage the PostgreSQL database for the project. 

## Overview

The database is designed to store trading data. This document outlines the contents of the folder and instructions on how to use them.

## Contents

- `schema.sql`: Contains the SQL commands to create the `,stock_info,trade_info,price_info` table with unique symbols for each company.
- `seed.sql`:  Contains sample data to seed the `stock_info,trade_info,price_info` table for testing and development purposes.
- `ERD.png`:  Contains Entity-Relationhip Model between three models

## Database Schema

- **annualised_volatility**:Projected volatility of the stock over a one-year period (numeric(38,2)).
- **tick_size**:The minimum price movement allowed for the stock (numeric(38,2)).
### 3. `trade_info`

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a Database**: If you haven't already, create a new PostgreSQL database for your project. You can do this using the `psql` command line or any PostgreSQL client tool like pgAdmin.

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
  
2. **Connect to Your Database**: Open your terminal or PostgreSQL client and connect to your newly created database.

   ```bash
   psql -U your_username -d your_database_name


3. **Run the Schema Script**: Execute the `schema.sql` script to create the necessary tables.

   ```sql
   \i path/to/schema.sql
## Seed Data

**Seed the Database**: The `seed.sql` script contains sample data to populate the tables for testing and development purposes. This can help you verify that your database is functioning correctly.

### Usage

To execute the `seed.sql` script, run the following command after connecting to your database:

```sql
\i path/to/seed.sql
